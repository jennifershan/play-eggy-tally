# play-pair-of-birds
Mod for the Klei multiplayer survival game [Don't Starve Together](https://www.klei.com/games/dont-starve-together) that gives player option to click button to match pair in the Trade Inn snowbird memory minigame [A Feastin' Pair of Birds](https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Inn#A_Feastin'_Pair_of_Birds) (was intended as a helper when stuck but may be better used as an out for the icon drop).
